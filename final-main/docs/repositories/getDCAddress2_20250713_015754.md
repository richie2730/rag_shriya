I cannot answer the question because the source code for the `getDCAddress2` project was not provided in the context.

To generate the comprehensive and accurate technical design document you have requested, I must be able to perform the required analysis, which includes:

*   Examining source code files, configuration files, and the project structure.
*   Identifying programming languages, frameworks, and dependencies.
*   Analyzing code patterns, data flow, API endpoints, and security measures.

Without the actual source code, I cannot fulfill these requirements. As per your instructions, I must not make up an answer or generate documentation based on assumptions.

Please provide the source code for `getDCAddress2`, and I will be happy to generate the detailed technical design document for you.
