**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Be Specific**: Use actual file names, class names, function names, and technology versions found in the code
2. **Be Accurate**: Only include features and components that actually exist in the codebase
3. **Update Diagrams**: Modify the Mermaid diagrams to reflect the actual system architecture, not generic examples
4. **Use Evidence**: Reference specific code files, configuration files, or documentation when making statements
5. **Stay Current**: Focus on the current state of the code, not assumptions or possibilities
6. **Be Professional**: Use clear, concise technical language appropriate for senior developers and architects

Generate this documentation based ONLY on the actual source code provided. Do not make assumptions about features that don't exist in the codebase.
